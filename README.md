# 😊 Emotion Detection Web Application

## 📘 Introduction
Welcome to the final project of this course! This project demonstrates your ability to build intelligent applications and deploy them on the web. You'll create an **Emotion Detection Web Application** using **Watson Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and deploy it using the **Flask** framework.

Emotion detection goes beyond basic sentiment analysis by identifying nuanced emotions such as **joy**, **sadness**, **anger**, and more from textual input. This capability is essential for enhancing user experience in AI-powered platforms like chatbots, feedback systems, and recommendation engines.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Develop an emotion detection engine using **Watson NLP**.
- Format and present emotion results in a user-friendly way.
- Package the application for easy deployment.
- Validate functionality through **unit testing**.
- Deploy the app as a **Flask-based web application**.
- Implement robust **error handling**.
- Perform **static code analysis** to ensure code quality.

## 📁 Repository Setup

### 🔗 Repository Links
- **Original Project Repository**: [Original Repository](#)
- **Cloned Repository for Cloud IDE**: [My Repository](#)

### 🛠️ Task 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local or cloud development environment:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-link>
```

---

## 🧠 Task 2: Build Emotion Detection Engine
Use **Watson NLP** to analyze user-input text and detect emotions. The model should return structured output indicating the detected emotions with confidence scores or labels.

---

## 🎨 Task 3: Format Output
Ensure the output is:
- Clear and readable
- Emotion labels are well-defined
- Suitable for display in a web interface

Example:
```json
{
  "text": "I'm feeling great today!",
  "emotions": {
    "joy": 0.95,
    "sadness": 0.02,
    "anger": 0.01
  }
}
```

---

## 📦 Task 4: Package the Application
Organize your codebase for deployment:
- Include a `requirements.txt` file
- Provide setup instructions in this README
- Ensure modular structure for scalability

---

## ✅ Task 5: Unit Testing
Create unit tests to verify:
- Emotion detection accuracy
- Input validation
- Error handling

Use frameworks like `unittest` or `pytest`:
```bash
pytest
```

---

## 🌐 Task 6: Deploy with Flask
Build a Flask web interface:
- Accept user input via a form
- Display detected emotions
- Host locally or on a cloud platform

Run the app:
```bash
python app.py
```

Access it at:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

---

## ⚠️ Task 7: Error Handling
Implement error handling for:
- Invalid or empty input
- API failures
- Unexpected exceptions

Ensure the app fails gracefully with informative messages.

---

## 🔍 Task 8: Static Code Analysis
Run tools like `pylint` or `flake8` to:
- Identify code smells
- Enforce coding standards
- Improve maintainability

Example:
```bash
pylint app.py
```

---

## 📄 How to Run the Application

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Flask App
```bash
python app.py
```

### 3. Access the Web Interface
Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

---

## 🧪 Testing
Run unit tests using:
```bash
pytest
```

---

## 📌 Conclusion
By completing this project, you will have built a fully functional emotion detection web application using Watson AI and Flask. This app demonstrates your ability to integrate AI models into real-world applications and deploy them for user interaction.
